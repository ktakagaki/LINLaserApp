# Leibniz Institute Laser App
JavaFX implementation of the online app available [here](http://www.lin-magdeburg.de/en/departments/systemphysiology/neuro_optics/apps/laserheating/index.jsp)

The app is based on the work of Arias-Gil et al. 2015 (in review) and developed at the (workgroup for Neuro-Optics)[http://www.lin-magdeburg.de/en/departments/systemphysiology/neuro_optics/team/index.jsp] at the Leibniz institute in 
Magdeburg, Germany.

Questions regarding empirical data and the pending article review should be directed to relevant people at the 
Leibniz institute.
